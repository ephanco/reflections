Lesson 2 although top header says 3

Lesson 2.4 Creating a repository
git init to create a git repository in the folder
git status to view its status

quiz says I should have an initial commit but it doesn't.
I suspect git changed "Initial commit" to "No commits yet" and the training isn't up-to-date.


What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Apparently it creates something that doen't match the video. I'm sure we'll need it later since git needs git repositories.

git init
git add
git status
staging area
working directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area gives you a chance to set up the change/commit before it is put into the repository. The working directory is just where the files exist.
